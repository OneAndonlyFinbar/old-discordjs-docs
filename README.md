# Better discord.js docs

This project was started to provide a better interface for discord.js documentation, much alike the documentation
used in discord.js v12.x.x, but for the latest versions of discord.js There have been numerous minor changes to the user interface
and planned are many more improvements to make the experience of using the documentation better and easier to digest.
